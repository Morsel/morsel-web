    <h2>Postings and Other Submissions</h2>

Your participation is voluntary; however, by choosing to create collections, post photos or comments, send any messages, submit any ideas or feedback, or otherwise participate in any Morsel forum, you acknowledge and agree that any postings, messages, text, photos, audio/visual works, information, suggestions, feedback, reviews or content provided by you (collectively, "Content") may be viewed by the general public and will not be treated as private, proprietary or confidential, and you authorize us and our affiliates, licensees and sublicensees, without compensation to you or others, to copy, adapt, create derivative works of, reproduce, incorporate, distribute, publicly display or otherwise use or exploit such Content throughout the world in any format or media (whether now known or hereafter created) for the duration of any copyright or other rights in such Content, and such permission shall be perpetual and may not be revoked for any reason. Further, to the extent permitted under applicable law, you waive and release and covenant not to assert any moral rights that you may have in any Content posted or provided by you.</p>
    <p>Morsel acknowledges and agrees that you, or your licensors as applicable, retain ownership of any and all copyrights in the Content, subject to the non-exclusive rights granted to Morsel in the paragraph above, and that no ownership of such copyrights is transferred to Morsel under these terms.

    <p>By posting or providing any Content on the Website, you represent and warrant to Morsel that you own or have the right to use and permit us to use and license such Content in the manner stated in this Agreement. By way of example and not limitation, if you post or otherwise provide a photograph which includes an image of any person, you need to first obtain permission or a release from such person appearing in the photograph to use their image and permit us to use and license it as stated in this Agreement and you must be the owner or licensee of the copyright in the photograph, with the right to permit us to use it as stated in this Agreement. By way of further example and not limitation, if you post or otherwise provide a photograph of a pictorial, graphic, sculptural or architectural work that is protected by copyright, you need to first obtain permission or a release from the owner of the copyright in such work to reproduce and adapt their work and permit us to use it as stated in this Agreement and you must be the owner or licensee of the copyright in the photograph, with the right to permit us to use it as stated in this Agreement.</p>

      <li>(2) is accurate, truthful and complete.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>You agree not to post or provide any Content that belongs to any person other than yourself or that contains the name, voice or likeness of any person other than yourself unless you first obtain permission to do so, and to grant to us the rights granted in this agreement, from that person.</p>
    <p>If you identify yourself by name or provide a picture or audio or video recording of yourself, you further authorize us and our affiliates, licensees and sublicensees, without compensation to you or others, to reproduce, print, publish and disseminate in any format or media (whether now know or hereafter created) your name, voice and likeness throughout the world, and such permission shall be perpetual and cannot be revoked for any reason.</p>
    <p>You further agree that we may use the posted or provided Content in any manner that we deem appropriate or necessary. We reserve the right to edit or abridge any Content for any reason, and to edit, refuse to post or remove any Content submitted by you or others. We cannot and do not guarantee that we will post all Content submitted or that such content will not be offensive, defamatory or objectionable.

Except as set forth in this Agreement, you may not copy, reproduce, modify, adapt, translate, republish, upload, post, transmit, distribute, sub-license, sell, reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble any part of the Website or any Service or Information without our prior written permission.

Use of the Website or any Services or Information for any other purpose is strictly prohibited. You acknowledge that you do not acquire any ownership rights by using the Website or any Services or Information.</p>
    <p>The trademarks, logos, and service marks displayed on the Website (collectively, the "Trademarks") are the registered and unregistered trademarks of Morsel, Morsel licensors and suppliers, and/or others. Morsel® is a registered trademark of Morsel Labs, Inc. Nothing contained in this Agreement or the Website should be construed as granting, by implication, estoppel, or otherwise, any license or right to use any Trademark(s) without the express written permission of Morsel, Morsel licensors or suppliers, or the third party owner of any such Trademark, except as set forth in the following paragraph.</p>

You will not take any action that is in conflict with our rights in or ownership of any Morsel trademark.

    <h2>No Use by Children Under 13</h2>
    <p>You hereby affirm that you are over the age of 12, as this Website is not intended for children under 13. If you are under 13 years of age, then you may not use the Website. You further affirm that you are fully able and competent to enter into the terms, conditions, obligations, affirmations, representations, and warranties set forth in this Agreement, and to abide by and comply with this Agreement.</p> 
    <h2>Claims of Copyright or Trademark Infringement</h2>
    <p>The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the "DMCA") provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. Morsel also reviews claims of trademark infringement. If you believe in good faith that materials hosted by Morsel infringe your copyright or trademark rights, you (or your agent) may send us a notice requesting that the material be removed, or access to it blocked. The notice must include the following information: (a) a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed; (b) identification of the copyrighted work or trademark claimed to have been infringed (or if multiple copyrighted works or trademarks located on the Website are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works); (c) identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or the subject of infringing activity, and information reasonably sufficient to allow Morsel to locate the material on the Website; (d) the name, address, telephone number, and email address (if available) of the complaining party; (e) a statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright or trademark owner, its agent, or the law; and (f) a statement that the information in the notification is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed. Please be advised that Morsel will not respond to complaints that do not meet these requirements. If Morsel determines that the materials alleged to infringe your copyright or trademark rights do not require removal, Morsel will remove those materials only pursuant to a court order declaring the content or use of the materials unlawful.</p>
    <p>If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send us a counter-notice. Counter-notices must include the following information: (a) your name, address, and telephone number; (b) the source of the content that was removed; (c) a statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the content was removed in error; (d) a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which your address is located, or if your address is outside of the United States, for any judicial district in which Morsel may be found, and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided the original complaint; and (e) a physical or electronic signature (for example, typing your full name).</p>
    <p>Notices and counter-notices with respect to the Website must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA (see http://www.loc.gov/copyright for details) and should be sent to the agent identified below. We suggest that you consult your legal advisor before filing a notice or counter-notice. Also, be aware that there can be penalties for false claims under the DMCA.</p>
